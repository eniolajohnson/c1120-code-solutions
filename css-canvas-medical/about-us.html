        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have fallen <br> dramatically short of their promise to improve
        the quality and efficiency of health <br> care. Clinicians spend far too long at their computers. Workflows are overly <br>
        restrictive. Valuable medical data is left unstructured.<br>
        <br>
        We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their technology <br> partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that
        mixes art and science - technology can <br> help or hinder this craft. Working with clinicians across the country, we think
        we <br> have begun to build something that helps. </p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p> Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna — a family <br> nurse practitioner — sacrifice family time
          in the evenings to "finish" charting. It <br> never ended.
          <br> <br>
          Andrew knew that the answer wasn't to go out and do it alone. He started to fill the <br> gaps in his experience. Seven
          practicing clinicians formed the clinical advisory <br> board — rather than leave practice to work full-time with Canvas,
          they used and <br> reviewed product changes in their practices. Our Medical Director, Dr. Zimmerman, <br> joined when he saw the
          potential of Canvas to help independent practices like his <br> practice, Temescal Creek Medicine in Oakland, CA. Julian
          joined Canvas after <br> working at Medicare and seeing the failures of current technology to keep up with <br> increasing
          regulatory demands without burdening clinicians. Joe and a world class <br> group of software developers joined to accelerate
          our ability to listen to clinician <br> feedback and constantly improve the product.
          <br> <br>
          With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting that completely <br> eliminates the need for menus and
          pop-ups. The name of the company describes <br> the charting experience — it feels like a blank canvas where you can tell the <br>
          patient's story and seamlessly complete notes, orders, and chart review on a single, <br> unified screen. With seamlessly
          integrated population health, billing, and practice <br> management, Canvas is a reimagined platform for the modern primary
          care <br> practice. </p>

        <h1>It's the foundation for patient- <br> centered primary care</h1>
        <p>Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians, <br> staff, and patients themselves — making
          you more productive, less <br> stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine</p>

              bounce around five windows to discover the last blood <br>
              count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your <br> note, so you never have to leave it. And because
              Canvas <br>
              learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every <br> patient you see.</p>

            <p class="italics">"Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance <br> dramatically on key quality metrics,
              and is incredibly easy to
              use. <br> The right information is presented in the right way at the right time, <br> and the product leverages
              technology to
              actually improve the <br> quality of care I provide."

        those are tremendously important <br> questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our old system! <br> Canvas is light-years

          It automates performance improvement
        </h2>
        <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you <br> understand performance, but they aren't enough to improve <br>
        quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality <br> protocols and charge capture so clinicians can <br>
        focus on more complex work only they can do.</p>

        <p class="italics">"With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as <br> ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were <br> going
        to keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of <br> coders to catch everything. The
        automation in Canvas has <br> completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue <br> performance."
